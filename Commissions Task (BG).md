# Requirements

- there are no strict deadlines, but lets keep in touch - if you have any problems or have no free time available for the task, just contact us;
- task must be made in PHP, choose your favourite version;
- third party libraries, dependencies, tools, frameworks etc. can be used if seems necessary. We would suggest to use `composer` for autoloading even if you do not use any external dependencies - we highly reccomend using PSR-4;
- your system must be maintainable:
    - clear dependencies between separate parts of your code;
    - system must be both testable and tested (unit tests are required);
    - code understandable, readable, have a clear flow;
- your system must be extensible:
    - adding new functionality or changing existing one should not require rewriting the system itself or it's core parts;
- code must be PSR-1 and PSR-2 compatible;
- minimal documentation should be provided:
    - how system should be ran (what command to run);
    - how to initiate system's tests (what command to run);
    - short description of functionality in more difficult places could be provided in the code itself;
- do not use external infrastructure dependencies, like MySQL databases or temporary files - just make the calculations in memory;
- do not use Paysera name in titles, descriptions or the code itself. This helps others to find the libraries that are really related to our services and/or are developed and maintained by our team.

# Task
## Situation

Paysera users can go to a branch to cash in and/or cash out from Paysera account. Several currencies are supported. There are also commission fees for both cash in and cash out.

## Commission Fees

### For Cash In

Commission fee - 0.03% from total amount, but no more than 5.00 EUR.

### For Cash Out

There are different commission fees for cash out for natural and legal persons.

#### Natural Persons

Default commission fee - 0.3% from cash out amount.

1000.00 EUR per week (from monday to sunday) is free of charge.

If total cash out amount is exceeded - commission is calculated only from exceeded amount (that is, for 1000.00 EUR there is still no commission fee).

This discount is applied only for first 3 cash out operations per week for each user - for forth and other operations commission is calculated by default rules (0.3%) - rule about 1000 EUR is applied only for first three cash out operations.

#### Legal persons

Commission fee - 0.3% from amount, but not less than 0.50 EUR for operation.

### Currency for Commission Fee

Commission fee is always calculated in the currency of particular operation (for example, if you cash out `USD`, commission fee is also in `USD`).

### Rounding

After calculating commission fee, it's rounded to the smallest currency item (for example, for `EUR` currency - cents) to upper bound (ceiled). For example, `0.023 EUR` should be rounded to `3` Euro cents.

Rounding is performed after currency conversion.

## Supported currencies

3 currencies are supported: `EUR`, `USD` and `JPY`.

When converting currencies, following conversion rates are applied: `EUR:USD` - `1:1.1497`, `EUR:JPY` - `1:129.53`

## Input data

Input data is given in CSV file. Performed operations are given in that file. In each line following data is provided:
- operation date in format `Y-m-d`
- user's identificator, number
- user's type, one of `natural` or `legal`
- operation type, one of `cash_in` or `cash_out`
- operation amount (for example `2.12` or `3`)
- operation currency, one of `EUR`, `USD`, `JPY`

All operations are ordered by their date ascendingly.

## Expected Result

As a single argument program must accept a path to the input file.

Program must output result to `stdout`.

Result - calculated commission fees for each operation. In each line only final calculated commission fee must be provided without currency.

# Evaluation Criteria

- all requirements must be met;
- code quality - it's maintainability, extensibility, testability; speed of the system can also be considered, but is not as important as other criteria.
